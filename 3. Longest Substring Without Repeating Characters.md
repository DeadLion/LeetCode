Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.


给出一个字符串，找出其中最长且没有重复字符子串的长度。  

abcabcbb ，子串为 abc ，长度为 3。  

bbbbb，子串为 b，长度为 1。

pwwkew ，子串为 wke，长度为 3。注意，答案要求的是子串， 如 pwke 是拼接过的，不是子串。
