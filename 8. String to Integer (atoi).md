Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.

Notes: It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front.

Requirements for atoi:  
The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. If the correct value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2147483647) or INT_MIN (-2147483648) is returned.


实现 atoi 将字符串转成整数。  
仔细考虑各种输入情况，如果你想挑战下自己，就不要看下面的提示，尽可能考虑到更多的输入情况。  


atoi 需求：

如果字符串第一个非空字符不是一个有效数字，或者空字符串，或者只包含空格字符，那就不转换。
如果无效输入返回 0，如果值正确但是超出范围，那就返回极限值，最大 2147483647 或最小 -2147483648 。
